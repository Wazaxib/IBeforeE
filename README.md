# I Before E, Except After C?
## Setting the Record Straight... Maybe..

### Goal:
To evaluate how well this rule works

### Hypothesis:
I've generally believed that the rule has too many exceptions, though what spurred me to do this project is that I realized I have no hard data to back that up.

So I'll say that I think the number of exceptions will be greater than 50% of the total occurrences

### Data Source:
[A list of common words from Google Books](https://norvig.com/google-books-common-words.txt)

### Methodology:
Use the 20k most common words, because that is the size of the average English speaker's vocabulary. Evaluate each word to see if it contains an "ie", an "ei", or neither, and whether or not it follows those rules

## Conclusion:
You can see the outcome from output.txt I was totally wrong, the rule applies 90% of the time so it's definitely worthwhile to learn
